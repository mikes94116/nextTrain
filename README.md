# nextTrain

A cool train arrival calculator that provides information on how many minutes away the next train is to arrive. 
It does this by factoring in the current time, automatically, as well as information that you provide as follows: 
The first train time and frequency in minutes that the train runs. 

A cool feature to check-out is the clock, which is pegged to the current time, and which is used to calculate the next train.
